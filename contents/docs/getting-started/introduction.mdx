Welcome to **Zyflo**, an animated UI library to create beautiful and accessible web application interfaces with a variety of interactive elements. Zyflo is meant to nurture flow and fluidity so developers can create visually appealing, fast interactions effortlessly. Whether it is an intricate animation or just some UI effects, Zyflo makes you comfortable with blending amazing UI elements to your already running projects without causing any harm in performance which enhance the user engagement. Using Zyflo, every part of your UI becomes a fluid continuum. 

## Why Zyflo?

Building Zyflo has always been a personal project for me as this is something I have longed to do: creating my own UI library. I think the idea of creating something that would enable others to build beautiful UIs felt really awesome. - This project was inspired by the amazing work of [Manu Arora](https://manuarora.in/) with AceternityUI and [Shadcn](https://shadcn.com) (with his open-source disclosure at shadcnUI & other projects). Manu and Shadcn both are the reason why I started exploring more into the frontend designing world and their design work has been a lot of inspiration for how Zyflo is developed. 

## Current Status

Zyflo is still actively being developed, much more is to come. The basis is made, but I keep working on enhance and clean the library to give it more and better life.

## Join the Journey

If you are an UI/UX designer or a frontend designer and passionate about your skills, then join me in this exciting adventure. I am actively reaching out for people who have experience in this and have a similar skillset. With your help, Zyflo can become an essential part of any developers and designers toolkit.
